			<p class="intro">President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law in July, which reduces federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $186 billion through 2034. The law also includes new provisions, like expanded work requirements, and it requires states to contribute to the cost of benefits. 
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				In 2024, approximately 41.7 million people per month received SNAP benefits, and as of now, about 3 million New York residents receive SNAP benefits. Due to the new provisions, 300,000 households could lose some or all of their SNAP benefits due to the modified work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD), according to a statement by Governor Kathy Hochul. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Losing SNAP benefits for New York City residents would add another cost to their monthly expenses, especially at a time when 61% of New Yorkers say it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet basic needs such as housing, food, healthcare, and education, according to a recent survey.

				Here is an overview of why SNAP is a vital source for food accessibility in New York:

					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> The price of food and beverages has increased by 25% since 2020, according to Fiscal Policy. A recent poll conducted by No Kid Hungry New York found that 53% of New Yorkersâ€™ debt has increased in the past 12 months due to the rising cost of food, and 86% of New Yorkers say the cost of food is rising faster than their income, which remained the same from last year. Due to inflation, food at home (groceries) costs made up 60% of total food costs in New York City in 2022-2023 in comparison to food away from home (restaurant and fast food) costs that made up 39.6% of total food costs, according to a recent report.

					<h4>Food Insufficiency</h4>
					<img src="images/noun-nofood2.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> The United States Department of Agriculture defines food insufficiency as a household sometimes or often not having enough to eat in the previous 7 days. The NY Health Foundation did a recent analysis on this issue and found that more than 1 in 10 New Yorkers struggle to access enough food. The food insufficiency rate is 10.4%, which is higher than it was during the early days of the pandemic in 2020 (10.2%). The demographics who were more than twice as likely to experience food insufficiency were Black and Hispanic compared to white New Yorkers.</figcaption>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">In January 2025, about 3 million New Yorkers received $655.9 million of SNAP benefits for the month, according to the Office of the State Comptroller. 1.8 million SNAP recipients were in New York City. The 5 community districts in New York City with the highest percentage of recipients were all in the Bronx, according to an analysis. The amount of SNAP benefits a household receives depends on its household size, income, and other factors. The maximum amount a household of one can receive is $298, whereas a household of eight can receive $1,789, and a household of eight or more family members can receive an additional $218 per person, as stated by the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.</figcaption>
